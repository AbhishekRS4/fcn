# FCN implementation on Cityscapes dataset

* Implementations of FCN-8, FCN-16 and FCN-32 with VGG-16 as the base
* [FCN](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf)
* [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)
* The images resized to 1024x512 are used to train the model
* 15 custom classes used

## To do
- [x] load pretrained vgg-16 model
- [x] fcn-8
- [x] fcn-16
- [x] fcn-32
- [ ] compute metrics for validation set
- [ ] sample results
